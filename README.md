# chest-xray-pneumonia-cnn
Deep Learning Project using CNNs for Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification

## Overview 
This project aims to implement an end-to-end deep learning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-Ray images as either the following, **Normal** or **Pneumonia**. The goal is to explore medical image analysis using modern deep learning techniques and evaluate model performance on real-world datasets.
